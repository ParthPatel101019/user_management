## Course Learnings Overview

### Understanding the Code Base
- Gaining an understanding of the code base was an iterative process involving reviewing documentation, exploring the code, and testing functionalities. This hands-on approach was crucial for navigating and contributing to the project effectively.

### Code Consistency
- Implemented the **Ruff formatter** to ensure code consistency across the project, improving readability and maintainability.

### Git Hooks
- Introduced to Git Hooks, I used them to format code automatically before commits, simplifying the development process and maintaining consistency.

### Test Cases
- Emphasized the importance of test cases to ensure the application behaves as expected under various conditions. This approach helps in designing a robust and fault-tolerant system.

### Planning
- Highlighted the importance of planning in development. Ten minutes of planning can save an hour of debugging, providing clear direction for problem-solving.

### Features and Issues
- **Implemented Features:**
  - Decided to implement the search feature. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/blob/main/search.md).

- **Resolved Issues:**
  - Handled empty/null query set ([Issue #4](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/issues/4))
  - Incorrect pagination metadata for search ([Issue #5](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/issues/5))
  - Incorrect querying ([Issue #6](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/issues/6))
  - Error searching by role ([Issue #7](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/issues/7))
  - Search by Role should be exact match ([Issue #8](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/issues/8))

### Test Cases
- Test cases documentation is available [here](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/blob/main/tests/test_services/test_search.py), and details regarding the test cases have been created as an [issue](https://github.com/ParthPatel101019/user_management/issues/10).
